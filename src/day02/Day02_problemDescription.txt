Part 1: Possible Games

In this coding challenge, you're given records of several games where a secret number of cubes of each color is hidden
in a bag. Your goal is to determine which games would have been possible if the bag had contained only a specific
configuration of cubes (e.g., 12 red, 13 green, and 14 blue cubes).

Part 2: Minimum Set Power

In the second part of the challenge, the Elf wants to know the minimum number of cubes of each color that could have
been in the bag to make each game possible. The power of a set of cubes is defined as the product of the numbers of
red, green, and blue cubes. Your task is to find the minimum set of cubes for each game and calculate the sum of the
powers of these sets.
